Learn how to use MicroProfile Rest Client to invoke RESTful microservices asynchronously over HTTP.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build a MicroProfile Rest Client to access remote RESTful services using asynchronous method calls. 
You'll update the template interface for a MicroProfile Rest Client, which maps to the remote service that you want to call, to use the `CompletionStage` return type. 
A `CompletionStage` interface allows you to work with the result of your remote service call asynchronously.

*What is asynchronous programming?* +
Imagine asynchronous programming as a restaurant. 
After you're seated, a waiter takes your order. 
Then, you must wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. 
While your food is being prepared, your waiter may take more orders or serve other tables. 
After your food is ready, your waiter brings out the food to your table. However, in a synchronous model, the waiter must wait for your food to be prepared before serving any other customers. 
This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

You can perform lengthy operations, such as input/output (I/O), without blocking with asynchronous methods. 
The I/O operation can occur in the background and a callback notifies the caller to continue its computation when the original request is complete. 
As a result, the original thread frees up so it can handle other work rather than wait for the I/O to complete. 
Revisiting the restaurant analogy, food is prepared asynchronously in the kitchen and your waiter is freed up to attend to other tables.

In the context of REST clients, HTTP request calls can be time consuming. 
The network might be slow, or maybe the upstream service is overwhelmed and can't respond quickly. 
These lengthy operations can block the execution of your thread when it's in use and prevent other work from being completed.

The application in this guide consists of three microservices, `system`, `inventory`, and `query`. 
Every 15 seconds the `system` microservice calculates and publishes an event that contains its average system load. 
The `inventory` microservice subscribes to that information so that it can keep an updated list of all the systems and their current system loads. 

image::QueryService.png[Reactive Inventory System,width=253,height=327,align="center"]

The microservice that you will modify is the `query` service.
It communicates with the `inventory` service to determine which system has the highest system load and which system has the lowest system load. 

The `system` and `inventory` microservices use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to send and receive the system load events. 
If you want to learn more about reactive messaging, see the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating Reactive Java Microservices^] guide.

// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================
== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed. For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker documentation^]. You will build and run the microservices in Docker containers. An installation of Apache Kafka is provided in another Docker container.

== Updating the template interface of a REST client to use asynchronous methods

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The `query` service uses a MicroProfile Rest Client to access the `inventory` service.
You will update the methods in the template interface for this client to be asynchronous.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryClient` interface.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java`
----

InventoryClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/client/InventoryClient.java[]
----

The changes involve the [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem` method. 
Change the return type to `CompletionStage<Properties>` to make the method asynchronous.
Since the method now has the return type of `CompletionStage<Properties>`, you aren't able to directly manipulate the `Properties` inner type. 
As you will see in the next section, you're able to indirectly use the `Properties` by chaining callbacks.

== Updating a REST resource to asynchronously handle HTTP requests

JAX-RS resources can also have asynchronous methods. 
These methods would return a `CompletionStage<Map<String, Properties>>` type instead of a `Map<String, Properties>` type. 
`CompletionStage` interfaces can be chained together by using the [hotspot=thenAcceptAsync file=0]`thenAcceptAsync()` method.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]

#Replace the `QueryResource` class.#
`query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java`
----

QueryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryResource.java[]
----

The `CompletionStage` interface represents a unit of computation.
After a computation is complete, it can be either finished or chained with more `CompletionStage` interfaces using the [hotspot=thenAcceptAsync file=0]`thenAcceptAsync()` method. 
Exceptions are handled in a callback provided to the [hotspot=exceptionally file=0]`exceptionally()` method, which behaves like a catch block.
When you return a `CompletionStage` type in the resource, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that the computation completed and the response was built.
JAX-RS responds to the caller after the `CompletionStage` completes.

A [hotspot=countdown1 hotspot=countdown2 hotspot=countdown3 file=0]`CountDownLatch` is used to track how many asynchronous requests that you're waiting on.
By using the [hotspot=await file=0]`await` method, the program stops and waits until all our requests are complete. 

Declaring the `values` variable with the [hotspot=volatile file=0]`volatile` keyword and instantiating it as a [hotspot=concurrentHashMap file=0]`ConcurrentHashMap` object allows it to store system information and safely access that information asynchronously from multiple threads.

// =================================================================================================
// Building the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

You will build and run the `system`, `inventory`, and `query` microservices in Docker containers. 
You can learn more about containerizing microservices with Docker in the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Start your Docker environment. Dockerfiles are provided for you to use.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command-line session in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

include::{common-includes}/ol-kernel-docker-pull.adoc[]

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
docker build -t query:1.0-SNAPSHOT query/.
```

Next, use the provided `startContainers` script to start the application in Docker containers. 
The script creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project, in addition to a network for the containers to communicate with each other.
The script also creates three instances of the `system` microservice. 

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/startContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```
--

The services take some time to become available. 
You can access the application by making requests to the `query/systemLoad` endpoint by going to http://localhost:9080/query/systemLoad[localhost:9080/query/systemLoad^].

When the service is ready, you see an output similar to the following example which was formatted for readability. 

[source, role='no_copy']
----
{
    "highest": {
        "hostname" : "8841bd7d6fcd",
        "systemLoad" : 6.96
    },
    "lowest": {
        "hostname" : "37140ec44c9b",
        "systemLoad" : 6.4
    }
}
----

Switching to an asynchronous programming model freed up the thread that handles requests to the `inventory` service. 
While requests process, the thread can handle other work or requests.
In the [hotspot=systemLoad file=0]`/query/systemLoad` endpoint, multiple systems are read and compared at once.

When you are done checking out the application, run the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--

// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the query microservice

You will create an endpoint test to test the basic functionality of the `query` microservice. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `QueryServiceIT` class.#
`query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryServiceIT.java`
----

The [hotspot=testLoads file=0]`testLoads()` test case verifies that the `query` service can calculate the highest and lowest system loads. 

QueryServiceIT.java

----
include::finish/query/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/query/QueryServiceIT.java[]
----

// =================================================================================================
// Running the tests
// =================================================================================================

=== Running the tests

Navigate to the `query` directory, then verify that the tests pass by using the Maven `verify` goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```

When the tests succeed, you see output similar to the following example:

[source, role='no_copy']
----
