Learn how to use MicroProfile Rest Client to invoke RESTful microservices asynchronously over HTTP.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build a MicroProfile Rest Client to access remote RESTful services using asynchronous method calls. You'll update the template interface for a MicroProfile Rest Client, which maps to the remote service that you want to call, to use the `CompletionStage` return type. A `CompletionStage` interface allows you to work with the result of your remote service call asynchronously.

*What is asynchronous programming?* +
Imagine asynchronous programming as a restaurant. After you're seated, a waiter takes your order. Then, you must wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. While your food is being prepared, your waiter may take more orders or serve other tables. After your food is ready, your waiter brings out the food to your table. However, in a synchronous model, the waiter must wait for your food to be prepared before serving any other customers. This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

You can perform lengthy operations, such as input/output (I/O), without blocking with asynchronous methods. The I/O operation can occur in the background and a callback notifies the caller to continue its computation when the original request is complete. As a result, the original thread frees up so it can handle other work rather than wait for the I/O to complete. Revisiting the restaurant analogy, food is prepared asynchronously in the kitchen and your waiter is freed up to attend to other tables.

In the context of REST clients, HTTP request calls can be time consuming. The network might be slow, or maybe the upstream service is overwhelmed and can't respond quickly. These lengthy operations can block the execution of your thread when it's in use and prevent other work from being completed.

The OpenLiberty Cafe application is designed with reactive architecture. 
The application that you'll be working with consists of six microservices : 
`Bar`, `Kitchen`, `Order`, `OpenLibertyCafe`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status`. 
It also uses Kafka to enable reactive messaging communication between the Producer and Consumer microservices over the messaging channels.

The microservice that you will modify is the `OpenLibertyCafe` service.
The `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice is a https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#variation-backends-for-frontends[backends for frontends^] service.
It communicates with the backend microservices on the caller's behalf.

The waitstaff places a request using the `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice.

The `Order` microservice consumes the request, produces order messages, and sends them to Kafka on the `food` or `beverage` channel depending on the type. 

An order begins with a `NEW` status. The `Bar` and `Kitchen` microservices illustrate how to handle the orders as a real cafe. They consume and process the order and update the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and `READY` consecutively. There’s a sleep operation in between each status to represent the order processing time, and the status updates are reported back to the `Status` microservice via reactive messages on the Kafka.

The `ServingWindow` microservice illustrates when the food and beverages are ready to be served. It consumes the `READY` order from the `Kitchen` and `Bar` microservices. Once the order is served, the waitstaff can mark the order as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent back to the `Status` microservice as a message.

The `Status` microservice receives status updates and provides queries for the waitstaff. All the orders are persisted here. Because persisting data is not the focus of this guide, the `Status` microservice simply uses a Map object to store the data.

The implementations of the application and its services are provided for you in the `start/src` directory.

== Updating the template interface of a REST client to use asynchronous methods

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The `gateway` service uses a MicroProfile Rest Client to access the `job` service.
You will update the methods in the template interface for this client to be asynchronous.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `JobClient` interface.#
`gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/client/JobClient.java`
----
JobClient.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/client/JobClient.java[]
----

The changes involve changing the return types of the [hotspot=getJobs file=0]`getJobs`, [hotspot=getJob file=0]`getJob`, and [hotspot=createJob file=0]`createJob` methods to return `CompletionStage<T>` types. These changes make the methods asynchronous. Since the methods now have return type of `CompletionStage<T>`, you aren't able to directly manipulate the inner types. As you will see in the next section, you will be able to indirectly use the inner object by chaining callbacks.

== Updating a REST resource to asynchronously handle HTTP requests

JAX-RS resources can also have asynchronous methods. So instead of returning a `JobsList` model type, you can return a `CompletionStage<JobsList>` type. Completion stages can be chained together by using the [hotspot=thenApplyAsync file=0]`thenApplyAsync()` method.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `GatewayJobResource` class.#
`gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/GatewayJobResource.java`
----
GatewayJobResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/GatewayJobResource.java[]
----

Similar to the synchronous approach, if completed jobs are successfully obtained from the `job` microservice, the resource responds with an HTTP status of 200 and the body will contain a list of jobs. Finally, return the `CompletionStage<JobsList>` result you built by using the [hotspot=thenApplyAsync file=0]`thenApplyAsync()` method.

The `CompletionStage` interface represents a unit of computation. After that computation completes, it can either be finished or chained with more completion stages by using the [hotspot=thenApplyAsync file=0]`thenApplyAsync()` method to perform more computations. Exceptions can be handled in a callback provided to the [hotspot=exceptionally file=0]`exceptionally()` method, which behaves similar to a catch block. When you return a `CompletionStage` type in the resource, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the computation completed and the response was built. JAX-RS will respond to the caller after the `CompletionStage` completes.

== Building and running the application

You will build and run the `gateway`, `job`, `system`, and `inventory` microservices in Docker containers. You can learn more about containerizing microservices with Docker in the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Install Docker by following the instructions on the official https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation[Docker documentation^]. Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal from the command line in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn clean install
```

Run the following commands to build and containerize the application:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
docker build -t job:1.0-SNAPSHOT job/.
docker build -t gateway:1.0-SNAPSHOT gateway/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

[role='command']
```
./scripts/start-app
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\start-app.bat
```
--

The services take some time to become available.
You can access the application by making requests to the `gateway` job endpoints:

[options="header", role="wrap_table"]
|===
|Description |Endpoint |Sample Output
|Get completed jobs |GET http://localhost:8080/api/jobs[http://localhost:8080/api/jobs^] |`{"count":0,"results":[]}`
|Create a job |POST \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs |`{"jobId":"661891cb-ad36-4ef4-9bb3-641f973f2964"}`
|Get a specific job |GET \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/{jobId} |`{"jobId":"661891cb-ad36-4ef4-9bb3-641f973f2964","result":5}`
|===


To create a job, you can use `curl -X POST \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs` command if available on the system. The Postman application can also be used. The request take some time for the job results to return.

The completed jobs JSON output with a created job looks like `{"averageResult":5.0,"count":1,"results":[{"jobId":"661891cb-ad36-4ef4-9bb3-641f973f2964","result":5}]}`. The `averageResult` attribute is the average sleep time of all the jobs. The `count` attribute is the number of jobs, and the `results` attribute contains the list of the jobs. The JSON output for each job has a job ID and a sleep time as the result for the job.

If no jobs are created, the JSON output will be `{"count":0,"results":[]}`. The `count` attribute is 0 and the `results` attribute is empty.


Switching to an asynchronous programming model freed up the thread that was handling your request to `/api/jobs`. While the request is processed, the thread can handle other work.

== Tearing down the environment

Navigate back to the `start` directory.

Finally, use the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stop-app
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stop-app.bat
```
--

== Great work! You're done!
